# Review Response

Thank you for the review! I've addressed all three points:

## 1. ✅ Use mcu.usb_if instead of going to IO directly
Changed from:
```ato
usb.usb.usb_if.d.p.line ~ mcu.gpio[19].line  # USB D+
usb.usb.usb_if.d.n.line ~ mcu.gpio[18].line  # USB D-
```

To:
```ato
usb.usb ~ mcu.usb_if
```

This is cleaner and uses the proper USB interface connection.

## 2. ✅ Use USB2_0TypeCHorizontalConnector instead of HorizontalUSBTypeCConnector_model
Changed from:
```ato
from "atopile/usb-connectors/usb-connectors.ato" import HorizontalUSBTypeCConnector_model
usb = new HorizontalUSBTypeCConnector_model
```

To:
```ato
from "atopile/usb-connectors/usb-connectors.ato" import USB2_0TypeCHorizontalConnector
usb = new USB2_0TypeCHorizontalConnector
```

Using the higher-level module that includes ESD protection and fuse.

## 3. ✅ Use actual LED components from standard library
Changed from custom `PowerLED_driver` to standard library components:

- **Power LED**: Now using `PoweredLED` from standard library
  ```ato
  power_led = new PoweredLED
  power_led.led.forward_voltage = 2V +/- 0.2V
  power_led.led.current = 2mA +/- 0.5mA
  ```

- **RGB Status LED**: Added three `PoweredLED` instances for RGB
  ```ato
  rgb_led_red = new PoweredLED
  rgb_led_green = new PoweredLED
  rgb_led_blue = new PoweredLED
  ```
  Connected to AW9523 GPIO outputs for PWM control.

## Additional Improvements
- Removed custom LED modules
- Added proper LED parameter configuration (forward voltage, current)
- Specified resistor packages (R0402)
- Connected RGB LEDs to the AW9523 PWM controller outputs

The Core module now uses only standard library components and established atopile packages, making it more maintainable and consistent with best practices.
