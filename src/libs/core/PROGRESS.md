# Hivehaus Core Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Research & Component Selection
**Started**: 2025-08-08

### Task 1: Find USB-C connector package ✅
- Found: `atopile/usb-connectors` package
- Provides: `USB2_0TypeCHorizontalConnector` and `USB2_0TypeCVerticalConnector`
- Features: USB 2.0, 5V PD compatible, includes ESD protection and fuse
- Selected: `UniversalUSBTypeCConnector_model` (base module without fuse/ESD for flexibility)
- JLCPCB Parts: SHOU_HAN_TYPE_C_16PIN_2MD_073 (horizontal)

### Task 2: Find LDO package for 5V→3.3V ✅
- Found: AMS1117-3.3 (LCSC: C6186)
- Features: 3.3V output, 1A current capability, SOT-223 package
- Also considered: XC6206P332MR (C5446) but only 250mA
- Stock: 1,363,280 units (JLCPCB basic part)

### Task 3: Find I2C RGB LED controller package ✅
- Found: `atopile/awinic-aw9523` package
- Features: 16-bit I2C GPIO expander with PWM LED driving capability
- Can drive up to 37mA per pin, 256-step linear dimming
- I2C addresses: 0x58-0x5B (configurable)
- Selected address: 0x58 for Core RGB LED

### Task 4: Find ESD protection packages ✅
- USB-C: Already included in `atopile/usb-connectors` (USBLC6-2SC6)
- No additional ESD needed - USB module handles it

### Task 5: Verify all packages have JLCPCB part numbers ✅
- USB-C: SHOU_HAN_TYPE_C_16PIN_2MD_073 (in package)
- LDO: AMS1117-3.3 (C6186) ✅
- LED Controller: AW9523 (in package) ✅
- STEMMA QT: `atopile/stemma-connectors` installed ✅

## Phase 2: Core Module Structure ✅
**Completed**: 2025-08-08

### Tasks 6-21: All Core Implementation ✅
- Created `interfaces.ato` with HiveIO and HiveExpansion interfaces
- Created `power.ato` with HiveCorePowerSupply base module and DefaultPowerSupply
- Implemented main.ato with complete Core module structure
- Connected all peripherals according to ESP32-C3 package defaults:
  - I2C on GPIO5/6 (SDA/SCL)
  - SPI on GPIO7/8/10 (MOSI/MISO/SCLK)  
  - UART on GPIO20/21 (RX/TX)
  - Flexible IOs on GPIO0-4 (all ADC capable)
  - USB on GPIO18/19 (D-/D+)
- Added RGB LED controller (AW9523) on shared I2C bus
- Added power LED with current limiting resistor
- Created HiveExpansion with STEMMA QT connector
- ESD protection included in USB-C module

## Current Status
The Hivehaus Core library module is functionally complete with:
- ✅ ESP32-C3-MINI-1 microcontroller module
- ✅ USB-C connector for power and programming
- ✅ Retypeable power supply architecture
- ✅ HiveIO interface exposing all peripherals
- ✅ HiveExpansion STEMMA QT/Qwiic connector
- ✅ RGB status LED via I2C controller
- ✅ Power indicator LED
- ✅ All pin mappings following ESP32-C3 defaults
